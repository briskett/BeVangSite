# BeVangSite
I was trying to make a website for a friend's restaurant, but we had to scrap the idea due to time restraints and financial concerns on my end.
I learned a lot while going through a bunch of tutorials online on how to use bootstrap to help save time with css and js. I also watched a youtube video to help me with one of the pages animations.
